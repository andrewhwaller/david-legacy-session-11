# Rebuilding the Fallen Tent

## Session 10: Great David's Greater Son

# Lk 6:1--5
One sabbath while Jesus was going through the grainfields, his disciples plucked some heads of grain, rubbed them in their hands, and ate them.
But some of the Pharisees said, “Why are you doing what is not lawful on the sabbath?”
Jesus answered, “Have you not read what David did when he and his companions were hungry?
He entered the house of God and took and ate the bread of the Presence, which it is not lawful for any but the priests to eat, and gave some to his companions?”
Then he said to them, “The Son of Man is lord of the sabbath.”

<!--
* Michael Wolter: “\[I\]n Luke Jesus argues not from the analogy of the situation but with the help of the authority of David, who overrides an instruction of the Torah. The concern is not with the question of what situations of distress override a Torah commandment... but with the right that David may presume for himself in relation to the Torah.”

# David, like Moses, is a “master of the sabbath.”

<!--
* For at least some early Jewish authors, then, when it comes to the temple and the observance of sacred time, David possesses a distinct authority.
  * Why do the Levites serve in their divisions and assist the priests in the temple? Because David commanded it.
  * Why do the temple musicians play their instruments and sing on the Sabbath? Because David taught them.
  * Who gave Israel inspired songs to mark every Sabbath of the year? David did.
* According to the texts surveyed above, David's authority in this sphere is not due to a generic royal or interpretive prerogative.
  * Rather, David's Sabbath authority flows out of his status as the prophetic founder of Israel's temple cult.
  * Stated perhaps more provocatively, if there is any figure within the early Jewish literary imagination that could attain to the title of "lord of the Sabbath," it is David.

# Lk 9:28--36
Now about eight days after these sayings Jesus took with him Peter and John and James, and went up on the mountain to pray.
And while he was praying, the appearance of his face changed, and his clothes became dazling white.
Suddenly they saw two men, Moses and Elijah, talking to him.
They appeared in glory and were speaking of his departure, which he was about to accomplish at Jerusalem.
Now Peter and his companions were weighed down with sleep; but since they had stayed awake, they saw his glory and the two men who stood with him.
Just as they were leaving him, Peter said to Jesus, “Master, it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah”—not knowing what he said.
While he was saying this, a cloud came and overshadowed them; and they were terrified as they entered the cloud.
Then from the cloud came a voice that said, “This is my Son, my Chosen; listen to him!”
When the voice had spoken, Jesus was found alone. And they kept silent and in those days told no one any of the things they had seen.

# Daniel 7:9--14
As I watched,\
thrones were set in place,\
&emsp;and an Ancient One took his throne,\
his clothing was white as snow,\
&emsp;and the hair of his head like pure wool\.\.\.\.\
I saw one like a human being\
&emsp;coming with the clouds of heaven.\
And he came to the Ancient One\
&emsp;and was presented before him.\
To him was given dominion\
&emsp;and glory and kingship,\
that all peoples, nations, and languages\
&emsp;should serve him.

# Exodus 34:29--30
Moses came down from Mount Sinai.
As he came down from the mountain with the two tablets of the covenant in his hand, Moses did not know that the skin of his face shone because he had been talking with God.
When Aaron and all the Israelites saw Moses, the skin of his face was shining, and they were afraid to come near him.

# 11Q5 27.1--11: “David's Compositions”
And David, son of Jesse, was wise, and a light like the light of the sun\.\.\.\.

# Pseudo-Philo, *Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum* 61.5--9
The Philistine looked and saw the angel and said, “Not you alone killed me, but also he who was present with you, whose appearance is not like the appearance of a man.”
Then David cut off his head.
The angel of the Lord changed David's appearance, and no one recognized him.
When Saul saw David, he asked him who he was, and there was no one who recognized him.

# Lk 13:31--35

At that very hour some Pharisees came and said to him, “Get away from here, for Herod wants to kill you.”
He said to them, “Go and tell that fox for me, ‘Listen, I am casting out demons and performing cures today and tomorrow, and on the third day I finish my work.
Yet today, tomorrow, and the next day I must be on my way, because it is impossible for a prophet to be killed outside of Jerusalem.’
Jerusalem, Jerusalem, the city that kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to it!
How often have I desired to gather your children together as a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you were not willing!
See, your house is left to you.
And I tell you, you will not see me until the time comes when you say, ‘Blessed is the one who comes in the name of the Lord.’”

# 2 Samuel 15:13--14
A messenger came to David, saying, “The hearts of the Israelites have gone after Absalom.”
Then David said to all his officials who were with him at Jerusalem, “Get up! Let us flee, or there will be no escape for us from Absalom.
Hurry, or he will soon overtake us, and bring disaster down upon us, and attack the city with the edge of the sword.”

# 2 Samuel 17:21
After \[Absalom's servants\] had gone, the men came up out of the well, and went and told King David. They said to David, “Go and cross the water quickly; for thus and so has Ahithophel counseled against you.”

# Lk 18:35--19:10
As he approached Jericho, a blind man was sitting by the roadside begging.
When he heard a crowd going by, he asked what was happening.
They told him, “Jesus of Nazareth is passing by.”
Then he shouted, “Jesus, Son of David, have mercy on me!” ...
Jesus said to him, “Receive your sight; your faith has saved you.”
Immediately he regained his sight and followed him, glorifying God; and all the people, when they saw it, praised God. 
He entered Jericho and was passing through it.
A man was there named Zacchaeus; he was a chief tax collector and was rich\.\.\.\.
When Jesus came to the place, he looked up and said to him, “Zacchaeus, hurry and come down; for I must stay at your house today.”
...
All who saw it began to grumble and said, “He has gone to be the guest of one who is a sinner.”
Zacchaeus stood there and said to the Lord, “Look, half of my possessions, Lord, I will give to the poor; and if I have defrauded anyone of anything, I will pay back four times as much.”
Then Jesus said to him, “Today salvation has come to this house, because he too is a son of Abraham.
For the Son of Man came to seek out and to save the lost.”

# Ezekiel 34:15--24 (cf. Jeremiah 23:1--8)
I myself will be the shepherd of my sheep, and I will make them lie down, says the Lord <sc>Lord</sc>.
I will seek the lost, and I will bring back the strayed, and I will bind up the injured, and I will strengthen the weak, but the fat and the strong I will destroy\.\.\.\.
Therefore, thus says the Lord GOD to them: I myself will judge between the fat sheep and the lean sheep.
Because you pushed with flank and shoulder, and butted at all the weak animals with your horns until you scattered them far and wide, I will save my flock, and they shall no longer be ravaged; and I will judge between sheep and sheep. 
I will set up over them one shepherd, my servant David, and he shall feed them: he shall feed them and be their shepherd.
And I, the <sc>Lord</sc>, will be their God, and my servant David shall be prince among them; I, the <sc>Lord</sc>, have spoken.

# Lk 19:29--40
When he had come near Bethphage and Bethany, at the place called the Mount of Olives, he sent two of the disciples, saying, “Go into the village ahead of you, and as you enter it you will find tied there a colt that has never been ridden.
Untie it and bring it here.
If anyone asks you, ‘Why are you untying it?’ just say this, ‘The Lord needs it.’”
So those who were sent departed and found it as he had told them\.\.\.\.
As he rode along, people kept spreading their cloaks on the road.
As he was now approaching the path down from the Mount of Olives, the whole multitude of the disciples began to praise God joyfully with a loud voice for all the deeds of power that they had seen, saying,\
&emsp;“Blessed is the king\
&emsp;&emsp;who comes in the name of the Lord!\
&emsp;Peace in heaven,\
&emsp;&emsp;and glory in the highest heaven!”\
Some of the Pharisees in the crowd said to him, “Teacher, order your disciples to stop.”
He answered, “I tell you, if these were silent, the stones would shout out.”

# 1 Kings 1:32--40
King David said, “Summon to me the priest Zadok, the prophet Nathan, and Benaiah son of Jehoiada.”
When they came before the king, the king said to them, “Take with you the servants of your lord, and have my son Solomon ride on my own mule, and bring him down to Gihon.
There let the priest Zadok and the prophet Nathan anoint him king over Israel; then blow the trumpet, and say, ‘Long live King Solomon!’
You shall go up following him.
Let him enter and sit on my throne; he shall be king in my place; for I have appointed him to be ruler over Israel and over Judah.”

# Lk 19:41--44
As he came near and saw the city, he wept over it, saying, “If you, even you, had only recognized on this day the things that make for peace!
But now they are hidden from your eyes.
Indeed, the days will come upon you, when your enemies will set up ramparts around you and surround you, and hem you in on every side.
They will crush you to the ground, you and your children within you, and they will not leave within you one stone upon another; because you did not recognize the time of your visitation from God.”

# 2 Samuel 15:30--37
But David went up the ascent of the Mount of Olives, weeping as he went, with his head covered and walking barefoot; and all the people who were with him covered their heads and went up, weeping as they went.
David was told that Ahithophel was among the conspirators with Absalom. And David said, “O <sc>Lord</sc>, I pray you, turn the counsel of Ahithophel into foolishness.” 
When David came to the summit, where God was worshiped, Hushai the Archite came to meet him with his coat torn and earth on his head.
David said to him, “If you go on with me, you will be a burden to me.
But if you return to the city and say to Absalom, ‘I will be your servant, O king; as I have been your father’s servant in time past, so now I will be your servant,’ then you will defeat for me the counsel of Ahithophel.
The priests Zadok and Abiathar will be with you there.
So whatever you hear from the king’s house, tell it to the priests Zadok and Abiathar.
Their two sons are with them there, Zadok’s son Ahimaaz and Abiathar’s son Jonathan; and by them you shall report to me everything you hear.”
So Hushai, David’s friend, came into the city, just as Absalom was entering Jerusalem.
